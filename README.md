Analyzing Stocks with VBA

## Overview of Project

### Background & Purpose
Steve, our client, has requested some help to create an efficient process to analyze green energy stocks. Our client's goal is to utilize this analysis to help his parents diversify their investment portfolio and improve their investment strategy with data backed decision making. Currently, Steve's parents' entire holdings are comprised of a single stock, Daqo (DQ).

Our source data included ticker data from 12 different green energy stocks, including DQ, for the years 2017 and 2018. We utilized an easy to use click-button that would analyze the volume and returns of those stocks in a given year, and display them in an ease-to-read format. After a working subroutine was created, our goal was to optimize the efficiency of that macro by refactoring its code.

## Results
From our analysis we can see that the Steve's parents should diversify their portfolio beyond just DQ. We were able to see the below satisfactory performance from  DQ in both years. In comparison to the other 11 stocks, DQ is one of the lowest performers. Almost all of the stocks we tested had positive returns in 2017, and only two stocks showed positive performance in 2018: ENPH and Run (each showed over 81% positive returns). Overall, this small snapshot of the green energy sector shows that there is significant volitility in this sector of the market. Additionally, this should provide Steve (our client) with a visual representation to show and convince his parents to diversify their portfolio.
