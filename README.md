Analyzing Sotcks with VBA Macros

## Overview of Project

### Background & Purpose
Steve, our client, has requested some help to create an efficient process to analyze green energy stocks. Our client's goal is to utilize this analysis to help his parents diverify their investment portfolio and improve their investment strategy with data backed decsion making. Currently, Steve's parents entire holdings are comprised of a single stock, Daqo (DQ).

Our source data included ticker data from 12 different green energy stocks, including DQ, for the years 2017 and 2018. We utilized an easy to use click-button that would analyze the volume and returns of those stocks in a given year, and display them in an ease-to-read format. After a working subroutine was created, our goal was to optimize the efficiency of that macro by refactoring its code.
